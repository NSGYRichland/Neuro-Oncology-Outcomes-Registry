# TumorTaskforce

This is just an example project to see how to use MySQL and Visual Studio to complete our tasks and upload them to gitHub.

The code is only functional on Laura's computer, as it connects to and is based on her local database. Once we have a remote database
established, we will create a new 'official' project which will connect to and be based on that database. Then it will be functional.
